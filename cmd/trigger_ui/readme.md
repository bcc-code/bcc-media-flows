# Trigger UI

Trigger UI is meant to serve a simple UI for triggering various export flows. 

The web UI is built with Go templates, so just simple server side rendering.

The service retrieves data from [vault.bcc.media](https://vault.bcc.media) directly to build and deliver options/alternatives.

It also stores some configuration back on triggering.
